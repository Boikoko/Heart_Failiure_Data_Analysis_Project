## 1. General info <a class="anchor" id="project-description"></a>

This repository serves as a centralized storage location for resources related to the Final Python Group Project. This project aims to assess the knowledge of Python, acquired by EXPLORE AI learners, in order to create a notebook report on a chosen dataset.The dataset chosen relates to heart-failure and various factors contributing to the death of heart-failure patients.

This Assessment aims to demonstrate the skills required for the following processes:

- DATA CLEANING and PREPARATION
- EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
- HYPOTHESIS TESTING

## 2. Datasets <a class="anchor" id="dataset"></a>

The dataset used in this project can be found in this GitHub repository under the directory Dataset.

## 3. Packages <a class="anchor" id="packages"></a>

The following packages were necessary to conduct this project sucessfully:

- `Pandas 2.2.3` and `Numpy 2.1.3`
- `Matplotlib 3.9.2` and `Seaborn 0.13.2`

## 4. Environment <a class="anchor" id="environment"></a>

For this project we will be required to use the conda environment management system. Below are instructions on how to set it up.

### Create the new evironment - you only need to do this once

```bash
# create the conda environment
conda create -n <Environment_Name>
```

### This is how you activate the virtual environment in a terminal and install the project dependencies

```bash
# activate the virtual environment
conda activate <Environment_Name>
# install the pip package
conda install pip
# install the requirements for this project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
